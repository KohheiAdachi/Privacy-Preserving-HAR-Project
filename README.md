# Privacy Preserving HAR Project

Sensor-based activity recognition can recognize simple activities such as walking and running with high accuracy, but it is difficult to recognize complex activities such as nursing care activities and cooking activities. So, various studies used multiple sensors to recognize complex activities. 
However, an increasing number of sensors increases the risk of user Re-identification.
In this project, we aim to build a HAR model for preventing user re-identification.
